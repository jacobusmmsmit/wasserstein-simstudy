# Script to compute W_2 with metric induced by the Euclidean norm, in 1d
# Distributions must be continuous.

n <- 1000 # Sample size

# 1.) Generate samples (they don't have to be normal)

muhat <- rnorm(n) # n samples from a standard normal
nuhat <- rnorm(n)

# 2.) Compute the empirical distance estimator
# I.e. sort the samples in increasing order for both muhat and nuhat.
# Compute the average squared Euclidean norm.
# Square-root.

sqrt(mean((sort(muhat) - sort(nuhat))^2))
